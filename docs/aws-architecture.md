# Architecture for RAG Chatbot Application

This document outlines the AWS deployment architecture for the Eloquent AI RAG Chatbot application, explaining key components, interactions, and best practices implemented in the solution.

## Architecture Overview
```
[Client] → [API Gateway] → [Application Load Balancer] → [ECS Fargate] → [Services]
                                          ↓               ↓
                                        [Cognito]       [Aurora, ElastiCache, Pinecone]
```

## Core Components

### Frontend Services

- **Vercel Hosting**:
  - Static site generation with Next.js
  - Global CDN distribution
  - Automated frontend deployments
  - Environment variables for backend integration

### Load Balancing

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
  - Routes traffic to ECS Fargate containers
  - Handles SSL termination
  - Performs health checks on backend services
  - Supports WebSocket connections for real-time chat functionality

### API Gateway

- **Amazon API Gateway**:
  - Managed API service for creating, publishing, and securing APIs
  - Request throttling and rate limiting to protect backend services
  - API versioning and stage management (dev, staging, production)
  - Request/response transformation and validation
  - API keys and usage plans for developer access control
  - Integration with Cognito for JWT token validation
  - WebSocket support for real-time chat functionality
  - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration
  - CloudWatch integration for API metrics and logging

### Backend Services

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate**:
  - Containerized FastAPI application
  - Auto-scaling based on demand
  - No server management required
  - Task definitions for different service components
  - Integration with CloudWatch for monitoring

### Data Storage

- **Amazon Aurora**:
  - High-performance managed relational database
  - PostgreSQL compatible with higher throughput
  - Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
  - Automatic scaling and replication
  - Tables:
    - `users`: Stores user information
    - `chat_sessions`: Stores chat session metadata
    - `chat_messages`: Stores individual chat messages

- **Amazon ElastiCache**:
  - Redis implementation for high-performance caching
  - Session management and temporary data storage
  - Reduces database load for frequently accessed data
  - Caches vector retrieval results for improved performance
  - Enables real-time features with pub/sub capabilities

- **Pinecone** (External Service):
  - Vector database for RAG implementation
  - Stores embeddings of knowledge base documents
  - Fast similarity search for context retrieval
  - Connected via secure VPC endpoints

### Authentication

- **Amazon Cognito**:
  - User pool for authentication
  - Identity pool for AWS service access
  - JWT token issuance and validation
  - Social identity provider integration (optional)
  - Support for anonymous users with session persistence

<br/>

### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch**:
  - Centralized logging for all components
  - Metrics and alarms for system health
  - Custom dashboards for key performance indicators
  - Log insights for query-based analysis

- **X-Ray**:
  - Distributed tracing across services
  - Performance bottleneck identification
  - Request flow visualization

<br/>

## Scalability and Reliability

### Auto-scaling

- ECS service auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization
- Aurora serverless option for variable workloads
- ElastiCache cluster scaling based on demand

### Availability

- Multi-AZ deployment for all services
- Aurora multi-region read replicas (optional)
- Health checks and automated recovery

<br/>

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Integration

- **GitHub Actions**:
  - Source: GitHub repository
  - Build: Container image creation with Docker
  - Test: Automated testing in staging environment
  - Deploy: ECS deployment with pipeline integration

## Cost Optimization

- Fargate Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Auto-scaling to match resource provisioning with demand
- ElastiCache reserved nodes for predictable caching needs
- Aurora Serverless for variable database workloads

<br/>

## Environment Management

### Multiple Environments

- Development, Staging, and Production environments
- Isolated resources per environment
- Consistent deployment across environments

### Configuration Management

- Parameter Store for environment-specific configuration
- Environment variables injected at deployment time
- Feature flags for controlled rollout
